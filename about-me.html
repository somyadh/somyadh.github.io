 <h3 class="amart">Hello, <br>
    I am new Back-end Developer but an experienced Software Developer. <br>
    I have worked as SDET for 4 years recently made the transition to Back-end development.<br>
    I am currently working for warehouse robotics startup called Pingspace in the beautiful Penang Island, Malaysia, building warehouse management system.<br>
    Prior to this, I worked as SDET for CISCO in City of lakes Bangalore, India.<br>
    I believe I am an effective team player and able to achieve common goals and business objectives.<br>
    <br>
    I love working on new technologies and explore new domains. <br>
    I am also believer in automating repeatative tasks and take keen intrest in desiging and building things from scratch.<br>
    Always open to take new and less travelled roads. Literally as well. <br>
    <br>
    I love to spend my time with family and friends; read novels; bake; take random road trips and discover new places to eat.<br>
    I am bilingual: Hindi and English and aspire to be a polygot:learning French(Bonjour ma ami!) and looking to travel and work across world.<br>
